# News_Aggregator

The news aggregator is a full-stack web application that utilizes python web scrappers to scrap popular news articles off of websites. It then proceeds to text a random news article to every individual within a postgres database.

I started this project back in May as a way to expand and demostrate my knowledge of coding across multiple languages. It was awesome to try and research new methods and new modules that I had never worked with in order to expand and flesh out the project.

One of the most difficult, and most rewarding, part of the project was trying to understand and to work with packages like postgres-node and Twilio. I had to use a lot of trial and error to understand the inner workings of the aforementioned packages. But, in the end, it was worth the experience and knowledge.
